# Sorting Algorithms in C++
This repository contains C++ implementations of various sorting algorithms for educational and practical purposes. Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science and plays a crucial role in data manipulation and retrieval. Understanding how different sorting algorithms work and their performance characteristics is essential for every programmer.

## Sorting Algorithms Included
Bubble Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Insertion Sort: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly taking the next element and inserting it into the correct position within the sorted portion of the array.

Quick Sort: A fast and efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to sort elements with an average and best-case time complexity of O(n log n).

Radix Sort: A non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping keys by individual digits which share the same significant position and value.

Count Sort: A sorting algorithm that sorts elements by counting the number of occurrences of each element and using that information to place elements in their correct positions.

Merge Sort: An efficient, stable, and comparison-based sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer strategy to sort elements.

## Usage
Each sorting algorithm is implemented in a separate C++ file and can be compiled and run individually. You can use these implementations to understand the algorithms' logic, compare their performance, or integrate them into your projects as needed.
